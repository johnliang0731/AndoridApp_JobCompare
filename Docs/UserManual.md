**Buttons:**
- User will be able to select two jobs for comparison (including current job) and press *Compare* button, which will jump to Session 6 *Compare Job Offer* page.
- *Cancel* button will allow user to exit and return to the main menu.

**Rule(s):**
- When ranking jobs, a jobâ€™s score is computed as the weighted sum of:
  AYS + AYB + (RBP * AYS) + (LT * AYS / 260) - ((260 - 52 * RWT) * (AYS / 260) / 8)

  The rationale for the RWT formula is:
  - value of an employee hour = (AYS / 260) / 8
  - commute hours per year (assuming a 1-hour/day commute) = 1 * (260 - 52 * RWT)
  - therefore travel-time cost = (260 - 52 * RWT) * (AYS / 260) / 8

  where:
  - AYS = yearly salary adjusted for cost of living
  - AYB = yearly bonus adjusted for cost of living
  - RBP = retirement benefits percentage
  - LT = leave time
  - RWT = remote work days per week



## 6. Compare Job Offers page

- *Compare Another* button will allow user to go back/jump to Session 5 *Job List* page to select two jobs for comparison.
- *Cancel* button will allow user to exit and return to the main menu.
